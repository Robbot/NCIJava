/**
Lab: Instantiable Classes

Problem 4

Route 66 is a highway in the USA with a length of 3,945 Km.  A cross country Bicycle race has been scheduled where people work in teams to cycle this highway non-stop from one end to the other.  The race has a rule that no one cyclist can cycle for more than 15 hours at a time.

You have been asked to develop an application that allows the user to enter the teamâ€™s projected average speed in kilometres per hour and the number of members on the team.  The application should then calculate and display:

-- the time it will take the team to complete the journey,

-- the number of full 15 hour blocks to be cycled,

-- how many full blocks each team member will cycle,

-- how many hours would be leftover at the end. 

Your application should be developed using instantiable classes.  All classes should be correctly commented and formatted.  Save your instantiable class as Route66.java


Route66App.java 
	-- takes input from the user
	-- uses the Route66 -- the instantiable class to perform different metrics computation
	-- outputs the metrics calculated by an object of type Route66 -- i.e. the instantiable class
